/*
Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:

Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

  if s<p
  if s = aaaaaaa p = a     map = {a:2}     result = []
           ^^                     
  if s = aaaaa  p = z
  if s = abcebc p = ab         a:1, b:1, c:1    jump start to end + 1 if end was not in map
      ababab    p = ab      //inc start ++ if complete match
  brute force = s X p
  our time complexity = O(s) space = map = p , result is not a part your actual algorithm so it doesn't count
               
               Typically, we consider space complexity in terms of Turing machines with:  one read-only input tape  one write-only output tape    however many read-write working tapes you want.â€©
               aka YOU GET YOUR WRITE TAPE FOR FREE, IF YOU NEVER READ THIS TAP THEN IT'S NOT A PART OF THE RUNTIME 
               
               THIS IS THE SLIDING WINDOW PROBLEM
  const result = [];
  if(s < p) return result;

          pMap[char]++;

          pMap[char] = 1;

  }

  
  now iterate through s with start pointer until find a match and then initialize end pointer until no match or count = 0
  for (let sIdxStart = 0; sIdxStart < s.length - p.length;) { //not until the end of s but until the last size of p
      let char1 = s[sIdxStart]
      if (pMap[char1]){
          pLen -= 1
          //if start index is within p then decrement count with the ends
          for (let sEnd = sIdxStart + 1; sEnd < s.length;) {
              let char2 = s[sEnd]
              while (pMap[char2] && pLen > 0) {
                  sEnd++
                  pLen--
              } //runs until pLen === 0 or char not in map

              }
          }
      }

  return result

  keep track when all zero'd out
  instead of iterating through map again for each char count, have a separate one for the entire length
