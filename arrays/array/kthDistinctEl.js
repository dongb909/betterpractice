/*Given an array of N integers, write a program to print K-th distinct element in the array. The given array may contain duplicates and the output should print K-th element among all unique elements. If K is more than number of distinct elements, print -1.

Input:
First line of input contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers.
Output:
For each test case, print the K-th distinct element as described above.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100000
1<=K<=100

Example:
Input:
3
6 2
1 2 1 3 4 2
6 3
1 2 50 10 20 2
4 2
2 2 2 2
Output:
4
