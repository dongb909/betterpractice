hash = n
hash length = m 
sort = mlogm
most freq recurring char = r
n + mlogm +nlogm NO because what happens when you push?
have to go n times for length of string but pushing is not m but logm
so nlogm is final time complexity
ex: arr in place then space = const but if create copy then space = n
using inputstring for index lookup = constant  if split copy then n


space: 
hash = m, or n beyond a-z
pq = m
have both so 2m = m
res = free because is just an output tape

Heap push = logn
heap pop = log n

because for the queue, your not technically removing but shifting and then adding back to the end.
